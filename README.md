## About This Bot
I've built this bot to assist Discord server owners and mods in detecting newer accounts that join the server for the purpose of phishing, scamming, stalking, spamming, or otherwise inconveniencing members. 
A server I'm a mod in has had a lot of trouble with users joining with art commission scams, and it has just been plain irritating. 

The bot can be configured to notify any number of channels, roles, and users.

You can set the boundaries of the notifications to only alert new members whose account is younger than a set time (Seconds, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months, Years) and/or those who join the server more than `x` number of times.

The bot will report when any individuals matching the strange-activity criteria Join, Leave, or are Banned.

Please note this doesn't do anything to dissuade or restrict their ability to join, but for servers with a limited number of mods this may help to narrow down which users to pay more attention to, or help clarify the likelihood of rule violations if a strange-activity user is reported for rule breaking.
